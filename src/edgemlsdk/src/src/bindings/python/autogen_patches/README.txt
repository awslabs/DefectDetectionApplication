While SWIG does have some facility to modify it's generated code through typemaps it falls short with modifying generated implementations
of interfaces using %feature("director"), which is needed for cross language polymorphism.  The files in this directory are meant to replace portions of the code
generated by SWIG at compile time such that the autogenerated code handles our use cases.

To apply a patch in must be specified in src/bindings/python/CMakeLists.txt
*NOTE: Because of how our regex expression is formed, don't use the (sub)string "return" anywhere in the patch file.  If you wanna fix this, go for it.

- Query Interface does not project correctly out of the box because SWIG doesn't know how to release our GUID object, nor return the correct object.
  Ixxxxx_QueryInterface.txt files

- Directors don't wrap method calls in SWIG_PYTHON_THREAD_BEGIN_ALLOW/SWIG_PYTHON_THREAD_END_ALLOW as SWIG expects that to be handled in the Python impl, but that doesn't quite fit our use cases
  Handled in patch.ps1

- Typical use case is Python calling C for object creation, which is handled by the typemaps in projections.i.  Going the other way, C calling a Python impl that returns an object is not supported.  
  Need to modify generated code to support this
    - IProtocolFactory_CreateProtocol.txt
    - IProtocolFactory_CreateMessage.txt
    - IProtocolMessage_Payload.txt

- Returning non null terminated char pointers (e.g strings), or any other pointers, in a fashion that is bidirection between python and C++.
  You can set it up to work for Python calling C++ implementation, or vice versa, but not both.
  Not currently needed (used to be) but an example of how to do this in IImage_Pixels.txt for reference for when we eventually need to do this
