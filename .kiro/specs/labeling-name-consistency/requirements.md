# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Defect Detection Application (DDA) Portal currently creates Ground Truth labeling jobs with inconsistent naming between the portal interface and the AWS SageMaker console. Users create jobs with meaningful names in the portal, but these names are not preserved in SageMaker, where auto-generated names with prefixes are used instead. This creates confusion and makes it difficult to correlate jobs between the portal and AWS console.

## Glossary

- **Portal**: The centralized web application for managing labeling workflows
- **Ground Truth**: AWS SageMaker Ground Truth service for data labeling
- **SageMaker Console**: The AWS web console for SageMaker services
- **Job Name**: The user-provided descriptive name for a labeling job
- **SageMaker Job Name**: The technical identifier used by AWS SageMaker Ground Truth
- **Job ID**: Internal unique identifier generated by the portal

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Data Scientist, I want labeling job names to be consistent between the portal and SageMaker console, so that I can easily identify and correlate jobs across both interfaces

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Data Scientist creates a labeling job with a specific name, THE Portal SHALL use that exact name as the SageMaker Ground Truth job name
2. WHEN a Data Scientist views the job in the SageMaker console, THE SageMaker job name SHALL match the name they provided in the Portal
3. THE Portal SHALL validate job names to ensure they meet SageMaker naming requirements before job creation
4. WHEN job name validation fails, THE Portal SHALL display clear error messages explaining the naming requirements
5. THE Portal SHALL prevent creation of jobs with names that would conflict with existing SageMaker jobs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Data Scientist, I want to understand SageMaker naming requirements upfront, so that I can choose appropriate job names without trial and error

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Data Scientist navigates to the job creation form, THE Portal SHALL display SageMaker naming requirements prominently
2. THE Portal SHALL provide real-time validation feedback as the user types the job name
3. WHEN the job name violates naming rules, THE Portal SHALL highlight the specific issues and suggest corrections
4. THE Portal SHALL enforce that job names contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens
5. THE Portal SHALL enforce that job names are between 1 and 63 characters in length

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Data Scientist, I want existing jobs to maintain their current functionality, so that the naming fix does not break existing workflows

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is updated, THE Portal SHALL continue to display existing jobs correctly regardless of their current naming scheme
2. THE Portal SHALL handle both old-style auto-generated names and new user-provided names in job listings
3. WHEN monitoring existing jobs, THE Portal SHALL use the stored SageMaker job name for API calls
4. THE Portal SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing job records in the database
5. THE Portal SHALL not require migration of existing job data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Portal Administrator, I want to ensure job names remain unique across the system, so that there are no conflicts or confusion

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Data Scientist attempts to create a job, THE Portal SHALL check for existing jobs with the same name in the target UseCase Account
2. WHEN a duplicate name is detected, THE Portal SHALL prevent job creation and suggest alternative names
3. THE Portal SHALL perform name uniqueness checks across all SageMaker labeling jobs in the UseCase Account
4. THE Portal SHALL provide clear error messages when name conflicts are detected
5. THE Portal SHALL suggest name variations when conflicts occur (e.g., appending numbers or timestamps)
